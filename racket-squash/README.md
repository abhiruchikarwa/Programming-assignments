The simulation of a single squash player practicing without an opponent is the machine that consists of a ball and racket
where the movement of the ball and racket responds to the passing of each tick of time.

Pressing the space bar starts the game. When the game is running, pressing the space bar again pauses the game for three seconds
and restarts the game.
While the game is running, racket can be moved by selecting with the mouse pointer, or by pressing the arrow keys.
The racket bounces if it collides with any of the walls except the front wall, which causes the game to pause and restart.
The ball moves after it collides with the racket or any of the walls except the back wall, which causes the game to pause and restart.
Balls can be added in the simulation by pressing the 'b' key, where every ball behaves as specified above.
